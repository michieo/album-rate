Known Bugs

It seems like when adding a new album, if you make it without giving it an album cover that page will be broken.

Importing data might break the site? - 'faulty album' imports causes weird buggy pages, after deleting them it works fine. but you just lose the import of them (This might be if the link you use for the album covers are temporary links, and then those links break. TBD)

The 'Clear History' doesnt seem to fully work/work at all

Cannot edit album cover once uploaded, massive oversight cuh
